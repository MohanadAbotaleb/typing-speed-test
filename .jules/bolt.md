## 2024-07-25 - Initial Optimization: Efficient Word Rendering

**Learning:** The initial implementation of `renderWords` in `Display.js` used `innerHTML` with a large string generated by `map` and `join`. This approach is inefficient for a large number of words because it causes the browser to parse the entire HTML string at once, leading to a single, blocking DOM update. This can cause noticeable jank and layout thrashing, especially on less powerful devices.

**Action:** For dynamically generating and inserting a large number of DOM elements, using a `DocumentFragment` is significantly more performant. By appending elements to a fragment and then appending the fragment to the DOM, we trigger only one reflow and repaint, instead of multiple ones for each element. I will apply this pattern to the `renderWords` function.
